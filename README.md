# Bootstrap Portfolio

- Week two basic reactive bootstrap portfolio modified into React App

## Description

Used bootstrap for to match the pictures provided in the assets. Made my own css to override bootstraps color and font preferences. Did not include a reset css as bootstrap has their own. Elements below were used from bootstrap.
social media links ommited from the homework as Instructor explicitly said to match asset pics as close as possible and they didn't portray any links.

- navbar
- sticky footer
- container/row classes
- form to make a responsive portfolio
