            I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a keen interest in UI/UX,
            recently graduating from the University of Washingtonâ€™s Web
            Development Bootcamp. I have worked in the medical and recreational
            cannabis industry since 2016. I owned my own recreational grow from
            2017-2018. Before that I worked in the restaurant industry for 10 or
            so years, and worked administrative positions in a couple of
            different places. In late 2018, life happened and I became a stay
            home mom. Coming from these industries and positions, I have team
            management experience, customer service skills, meticulous attention
            to detail, and creative problem solving skills.. I am driven, an
            ambitious fortune thinker that learns and evolves quickly and will
            be an asset to your team. Now armed with skills in mobile first web
            design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and jQuery, I am ready to
            utilize all of my skills in an exciting new Web Development
            position.
